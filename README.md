FUN.d have skillfully crafted a mechanism where companies ready to give back to the society can do so in a more interactive way. Also there are many people in the software industry, whose work does not allow them to make time for charity events. Hence we decided to bridge the gap between the two by proposing a solution. We created an online charity fundraiser 'FUN.D' with a twist. Software enthusiasts get to solve challenges and puzzles in code to increase the funds that the host company donates. In addition, they can also donate to the cause directly. The host can make use of this platform to collect data in the form of solutions to their code challenges, which can be implemented by the company for further research.

APIs Integrated :
- Website using Meteor.js
- PayPal for mode of Payment.
- Coding challenges with a editor which supports syntax highlighting
